Welcome to SubtitleCreator!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This new version serves two purposes. You can use it to:

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
1. Overlay subtitles on top of an existing DVD.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
2. Add subtitles to an existing copyright-free DVD.

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let me first explain how to use it as a standalone DVD player.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Check that in the <u>Settings</u> menu, you have selected to overlay the subtitles.

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Next, press Ctrl-O to open your subtitle file.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Finally, open the DVD using the left-most button on the DVD panel.

9
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The subtitles will now be displayed on top of the DVD.

10
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Right click the DVD to put it into Full screen mode.

11
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If the synchronization is off, read on, and you will find some tips below.

12
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
In case you wish to add a subtitle to a DVD, read on.

13
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I expect that you already have copied a DVD to your harddisk (e.g. by using the program <u>DVDshrink</u>).

14
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The easiest way to proceed, which will work in most cases, is by using the DVD authoring wizard.

15
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You can find it in the <u>Tools</u> menu or by pressing CTRL-W.

16
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The wizard uses three great freeware tools, PgcDemux, MuxMan and VobBIanker.

17
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The first time you open the Wizard, it will ask you to locate these tools on your disk.

18
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Next, the wizard will ask you to open your copyright free DVD.

19
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If the DVD already has some subtitles, PgcDemux will start to extract them.

20
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:20,001
This is useful when synchronizing your subtitles with the movie.

21
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Now, select your subtitle's language and the subtitle file.

22
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:59,000
SubtitleCreator's main window is shown again, and the DVD will start playing.

23
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:20,001
First, position the subtitle vertically using the panel at the right.

24
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If you want, you can change the font in the <u>Format</u> menu.

25
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Now we are getting to the hardest bit, the synchronization.

26
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If the original movie has some subtitles, it's best to use them.

27
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:40,001
Stop the movie and open the <u>Synchronize</u> menu.

28
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Load one of the existing subtitles.

29
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If PgcDemux is still busy extracting it, you have to wait a bit.

30
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,000
When the Synchronize window pops up, you just have to select matching subtitles left and right.

31
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:59,000
For each match, press the + button in the middle.

32
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Normally, it's enough to select one match near the start of the movie, and one near the end.

33
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Press <u>Synchronize</u>, and that's it! If you want, you can automatically set the vertical position here too.

34
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You can verify the synchronization by double-clicking on a subtitle in the left panel.

35
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:20,001
It should automatically select the translated version in the right panel.

36
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Press <u>Done</u> when you are satisfied.

37
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You are almost there: press <u>Create SUP and return to wizard</u> in the right panel.

38
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,000
When the Wizard returns, press <u>Start</u> and have a coffee.

39
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Afterwards, you will find your new DVD with subtitle in the VIDEO_TS directory of your movie.

40
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Let me finish with a couple of tips:

41
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,000
TIP 1: For synchronization, you can also use the DVD sync window. Watch the movie, pause it, and insert the subtitle that should FINISH here.

42
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:40,000
TIP 2: When the movie is paused, you can select a subtitle and press the green arrow to jump to this subtitle in the movie.

43
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:59,001
TIP 3: You can edit the subtitle text, and time, by double-clicking on them, or using the <u>Edit</u> menu.

44
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:20,002
TIP 4: You can use <i>Italic</i> and <b>Bold</b> too.

45
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:40,000
<L>TIP 5: Large font is also possible!

46
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:59,000
TIP 6: SubtitleCreator automatically tries to fix spaces. Turn it off if you get errors with numbers, like $5,000.

47
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:20,000
TIP 7: SubtitleCreator automatically unselects sentences with @ or http. You can turn that off too (<u>Settings</u>).

48
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:40,000
TIP 8: You can translate existing DVD subtitles using the Translation <u>Tool</u> or using Google Translate.

49
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:59,000
TIP 9: You can reposition exsisting DVD subtitles using the SUP <u>Tool</u>.

50
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
TIP 10: You can also change the <u>Synchronization</u> using frame rate conversion or setting a delay.

51
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:40,000
TIP 11: To insert special symbols like a music symbol, type <s M/> or use the menu at the bottom right.

52
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:59,000
TIP 12: If you change the default settings, you can store them in the <u>Profile</u> menu.

53
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:20,000
TIP 13: Each subtitle's position can be set independently: go to the <u>Settings</u> menu and uncheck to select all subtitles.

54
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:40,000
TIP 14: You can change the GUI language in the <u>Settings</u> menu: if you wish to help by translating it, contact me at Erik.Vullings AT gmail.com.

55
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Tip 15: You can also insert pictures that reside in the same directory as your text file, as the next example will show you.
