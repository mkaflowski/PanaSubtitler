This program merge idx and srt subtitles to movies and creates MKV files in the specified path. When you drag a folder from filmeme will see all movies in it and added to the queue. You can add more directories. Export path will be saved and read after restarting the program. If so we want to work such as the season of the series just drag the folder to him and click export and the files will be converted to our favorite places (such as external hard disk). 

IDX subtitles can be automatically prepared by SubtitleCreator when selecting the appropriate box. If you want to modify the subtitle format, modify the profile 1st or 2nd in xml in SubtitleCreator. USE ANSI CODING FOR SRT SUBTITLES
